% Make a predicate delete_one(El, L, L1) which removes the first occurence of El from list L.

% Make a predicate delete_all(El, L, L1) which removes all occurences of element El from the list L.

% Make a predicate that checks if all elements in a list are equal.

% Make a predicate is_longer(L, L1) that checks if list L is longer than list L1.

% Make a predicate len which gets the length of list L.

% Make a predicate num_occurrences(El, L, N), so that the number N is the number of occurrences of element El in list L.

% Make a procedure sum(L, Res) such that Res is the sum of integers in list L. L can contain non-integer structures.

% Make a procedure is_list(L) that checks if L is a list. 
% We don't consider [a,b,c|d] a list, because it does not end with an empty list [].

% Make a procedure is_palindrome(L) that checks if list L is a palindrome.

% The reversed list of an empty list is an empty list.
