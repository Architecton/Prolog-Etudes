% Make a predicate last(List, El) which returns the last element of the list.

% Make a predicate add_last(El, L, L2) which adds element El to the end of list L2.

% Make a predicate nth that returns the nth element of the list.

% Make a predicate sublist(SubL, L) which returns true if SubL is a sublist of L.

% Make a predicate split(L, H, T) so that H is the head of list L and T is the tail of list L.

% Make a predicate add_start(El, L, L1) which adds element El to list L.

% Make a predicate right_element which finds the right element of element El int the list L.

% Make a predicate first(L, El) which finds the first element of list L.

% Make a predicate delete(El, L, L1) which deletes element El from list L.


% The recursive definition of a list in Prolog:
% 1. A list can be empty.
% 2. A list can have a head, which is an expression and a tail which is a list [Head|Tail].

% Make a predicate contains which checks if element El is contained in list L.
