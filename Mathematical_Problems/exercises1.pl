% Make a predicate s(N, N1), which is true if N1 = N + 1. The predicate shoudl work for all 4 possible situations:
% As a check, as a successor generator, as a predecessor generator and as a generator of pairs of positive integers in relation s.

% Make a predicate issum(A, B, Summa), which checks if A - B = Summa. You may only use the predicate s from the previous task. A and B can be
% positive or equal to 0.

% Make a predicate isdiff(A, B, Diff) which checks if A - B = Diff. 
% You may only use the predicate s from the previous task. A is greater or equal to 0, B is less or equal to A.


% similar for product (isprod(A, B, Prod))

% similar for integer division (isdiv(A, B, Div))

% Make a predicate num_digits(X, Digits) so that Digits is the numer of decimal digits of number X.
% You may only use predicates from the previous tasks.

% Make a predicate power(A, Pow, Res) so that Res is equal to A^Pow. Pow is an integer greater or equal to 0.
% You may only use predicates from the previous tasks.

% Make a predicate abs(X, AbsX) so that AbsX = |X|

% Make a predicate sign(X, signX) so that signX is equal to 1 if X > 0, equal to 0 if X = 0 and equal to -1 if  X < 0.

% Make a predicate is_prime(X) which checks if X is a prime number

% Make a predicate not_prime(X) which checks if X has a divisor that is not equal to 1 or X (is not prime).

% Make a program for converting roman numerals to arabic numerals.
